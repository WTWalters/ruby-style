- :rule: "Use RDoc instead of YARD or TomDoc"
  :why: "RDoc.info does not support TomDoc, and YARD is way too heavyweight"
- :rule: "Do not surround class or method names in your project with code blocks"
  :why: "RDoc will link to methods or classes in your project"
- :rule: "DO surround class or method names from other libraries with code blocks"
  :why: "This makes it clear that you mean a method name or class, because RDoc cannot link outside of your codebase"
- :rule: "Reserve inline comments for answering 'Why?' questions"
  :why: "Don't restate what the code does, but DO explain why it works the way it does, especially if it does something in a suprising or weird way, from a business logic perspective"
  :example: |
    ## Wrong; don't explain what the code does, we can read it
    def minor?
      # Check if they are under 19
      self.age < 19
    end

    ## Right; explain the odd logic so others know it is intentional, with
    ## a ref for more info as to why
    def minor?
      # For our purposes, an 18-year-old is still a minor.  See
      # ticket XYZ for a more detailed discussion
      self.age < 19
    end
