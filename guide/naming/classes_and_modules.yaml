- :rule: "For non-Rails apps, namespace all classes in a top-level module named for your app or library"
  :why: "Prevents naming clashes when your code is used with other libraries"
- :rule: "Class names should be comprehensible without their module namespace."
  :why: "Ensures that classnames are understood everywhere used."
  :example: |
    # Wrong; 'Base' is not an accurate classname
    class ActiveRecord::Base
    end

    # Good; using the class without its namespaced module doesn't remove any clarity
    class Gateway::BraintreeGateway
    end

- :rule: "Class names should be nouns"
  :why: "Classes represent things, and things are nouns"
- :rule: "Non-namespace module names should tend toward adjectives, e.g. `Enumerable`"
  :why: "Modules used as mixins represent a trait or aspect that you want to use to enhance a class.  These are naturally adjectives."
- :rule: "Namespace module names should tend toward nouns"
  :why: "Using modules just for namespacing is, again, specifying things, which are nouns"
